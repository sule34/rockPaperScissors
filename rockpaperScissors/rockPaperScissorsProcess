PSEUDOCODE:
set variable keepPlaying to true
While keepPlaying is true:
    #print statement welcoming players to the game 
    #print statement stating the rules (best 2 out of 3 Press 'q' to quit)
    
    make a key that assigns a number to each choice for the computer 
    (rock is 1, scissors is 2, paper is 3)
    
    import the random function - the computer makes its choice randomly from this function
    
    set computer's score to 0
    set player's score to 0
    
    white player's score is less than 2 and computer's score is less than 2: -- this means that the game is still on
    
        computer's choice = random number between 1 and 3 (random function gets used here)
        player's choice = input(ask player to select Rock, Paper or Scissors)
        
        start checking user options
        userChoice = userChoice.lower()
        if player inputs 'q': --player wants to end the game
            set keepPlaying to False --ends the loop
            stop the loop -- whoo! break the statement
        
        else if (player inputs rock and computer chooses rock) or
